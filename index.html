        <p> About Me: I am a second year student pursing a Computer Science Major at the University of the West Indies Mona . 
            I am interested in Website Design because during my first year when I was not really sure about what I really wanted out of the degree I was beginning to purse, 
            I got an assignment from the course COMP1220: Computing and Society. 
            I realised while doing the exercise of building and learning how to build the website that I was truly enjoying the process and watching my website go from a blank page to something with various colours and content that I created.
